## Introduction
IPsec JSON is a specification for describing IPsec VPN connection profiles, cipher suites and associated network configurations in JSON [RFC4627].

IPsec is notoriously difficult to configure and test, particularly cross-vendor interoperability. IPsec JSON is designed to provide a common, unambiguous language that can be transformed programmatically into vendor-specific device configurations.
